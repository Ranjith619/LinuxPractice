RMMessage from Rodny Molina: i've always found this kernel logical-add vs linear/virtual-add a bit confusing. Both spaces are considered 'virtual' space, right? So the virt-to-phy mapping is what changes between one and the other, correct? Contigous in one case vs random in the other. Am i getting this right?
